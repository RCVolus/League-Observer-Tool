# league-observer-tool
The observer tool is part of our [lol-prod-toolkit](https://github.com/RCVolus/league-prod-toolkit).
The tool is used to query local client APIs (LCU, ingame) and send the data to a local or remote instance of prod-toolkit.
Once install, the observer tool automatically updates to any new versions released.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/RCVolus/league-observer-tool/releases/latest)
2. Install and run the observer tool
3. Configure the toolkit instance:
* Open the settings file by selecting File -> Open Settings
* Configure the appropriate IP (`"server-ip": "127.0.0.1"` for locally hosted toolkit)
* Before saving, close the Observer Tool either from the tray or with File -> Quit
* Save the changed config file

The config file might look like this for a local toolkit without authentication:
```json
{
  "server-ip": "127.0.0.1",
  "server-port": 3003,
  "server-api-key": "",
  "replay-sync-mode": "get",
  "live-events-port": 34243
}
```
If you have authentication enabled, set a key (`RCVPT-...`) in `server-api-key`. If the toolkit isn't running locally, set the toolkit IP in `server-ip`.

## A Note on Memory Reading
Since version 5.0.0, the Observer tool implements passive memory reading based on [Farsight](https://github.com/floh22/native-farsight-module). Riot has previously stated passive memory reading is allowed, although this policy might change at any time without warning. Currently, memory reading while spectating should not cause you issues. Make sure you turn off the observer tool when playing games. Use at your own risk.

Since memory offsets change with every patch and need to be updated, memory reading will not work immediately after game updates. Farsight has a [guide](https://github.com/floh22/native-farsight-module) on updating offsets yourself.

## Setting up LiveEvents API
For ingame Events (e.g., Dragon or Baron kills), the LiveEvents API needs to be configured locally:
1. Add the following to `game.cfg` (located in `[install path]\Riot Games\League of Legends\Config`):
```ini
[LiveEvents]
Enable=1
Port=34243
```
Make sure the port is the same as configured in the observer tool settings under `live-events-port`.

2. Create a file called `LiveEvents.ini` in the same config directory
3. Paste the following in the `LiveEvents.ini` file:
```ini
OnKillDragon_Spectator
OnKillRiftHerald_Spectator
OnKillWorm_Spectator
OnTurretPlateDestroyed
OnDragonSoulGiven
```

## Usage
The power button at the bottom connects to the configured toolkit instance.
To connect to local League Client APIs, click Sync on the modules you need. The League Client needs to be running.
